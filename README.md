# AngularEducationBackend

This is built for one of my internal Angular educations. The education was split into frontend and backend and this project is the backend part. The aim of the project is to show how a Angular app can communicate with a ASP.NET WebApi. The backend contains a simple ASP.NET WebApi to create and list games
